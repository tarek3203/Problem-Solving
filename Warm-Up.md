Learn more about header files [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/header-files-in-c-cpp-and-its-uses/). So, you might need to include lots of header files if you use lots of stuff in your code. For example, for using input-output, you need to include the iostream header file, for using string you need to include the string header file etc. But fear not, there is one header file that includes everything! Just include the bits/stdc++.h header file and you won't need to use any other headers.
